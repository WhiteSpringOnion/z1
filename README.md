# Machine learning for patient stratification and classification
Machine learning workshop for the UP-MIT Critical Data-Stanford Big Data for Health Workshops and Conference 

This workshop will introduce the audience to machine learning techniques. Participants will explore the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning and practice implementing them using Python and the SciPy ecosystem. The workshop will focus on patient stratification and classification, for decision support in the intensive care unit.
